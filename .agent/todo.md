- [x] Remove tracked Python bytecode artefacts from `barter-python/tests_py/__pycache__`.
- [x] Finalize `shutdown_with_summary` bindings (Rust + Python tests + docs).
- [x] Ensure summary serialization returns rich Python objects.
- [ ] Update packaging metadata (wheel classifiers, maturin settings) once API settles.
- [ ] Plan integration tests covering live system lifecycle vs. backtest.

## Completed
- [x] Expand `barter-python` bindings to cover engine configuration and system control.
- [x] Mirror key configuration structs (SystemConfig) in Python API.
- [x] Provide runtime helpers to run trading system from Python via async tasks.
- [x] Add Python-level integration tests exercising basic system lifecycle.
