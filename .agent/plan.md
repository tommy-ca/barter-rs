# Porting Plan (2025-10-03)

## Immediate Objectives
1. Review existing bindings and overall repository state (2025-10-03 âœ…).
2. Outline desired Python API surface and prioritise components for the initial release (2025-10-03 âœ…).
3. Implement Rust-to-Python wrapper modules and supporting ergonomics (2025-10-03 âœ…).
4. Integrate packaging, build scripts, and CI wiring to publish Python artifacts (2025-10-03 âœ…).
5. Add essential unit & end-to-end tests alongside updated documentation (initial integration
   suite implemented 2025-10-03; see `.agent/specs/python-integration-tests.md`) (2025-10-03 âœ…).

## Completed (2025-10-04)
1. Establish cross-language maintenance workflow (Rust + Python) including branching strategy and release cadence.
2. Identify remaining Rust APIs requiring Python exposure (risk manager configuration âœ… 2025-10-04; portfolio analytics extensions â€” profit factor, win rate, rate of return â€” shipped 2025-10-04; initial balance seeding âœ… 2025-10-04).
3. Produce incremental TDD plan emphasising new bindings with paired Rust/Python coverage.
4. Align CI to run `cargo test`, `pytest`, and packaging checks on every push & PR (âœ… 2025-10-04 via `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
5. Prepare developer onboarding notes for maintaining the hybrid workspace (âœ… 2025-10-04; see `docs/developer-onboarding.md`).
